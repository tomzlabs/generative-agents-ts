## Projects
- **ScreenshotKB**: A local-first, privacy-focused screenshot search app for iOS (React Native/Expo).
    - **Status**: Skeleton built. Upgraded from mock OCR to real `react-native-text-recognition`.
    - **Tech Stack**: Expo, SQLite, NativeWind, on-device OCR.
    - **Goal**: Polish and release to App Store as a paid utility ($2.99).
    - **Next Steps**: Run prebuild to link native modules, test on simulator, polish UI.

## Decisions
- User selected "Option 2" (ScreenshotKB) as the primary "money-making" product to focus on, prioritizing stability and passive income over quick crypto flips.
- Attempted to use Clawdbot Chrome extension for Twitter automation but connection failed; user instructed to install it.

## Context
- User is interested in "making money" via apps.
- User previously explored creating a token ($CLAWD) on four.meme (BNB chain).
