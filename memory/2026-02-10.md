# 2026-02-10

- Upgraded global top navigation to a premium pixel style with better mobile behavior.
- Refactored `VillageMap` UI into card-based layout and improved responsive structure.
- Added map render safety: dynamic `maxCanvasScale` and `effectiveScale` to avoid large-canvas blank rendering.
- Added safer contract-address copy handler with fallback alert.
- Updated app scroll container offsets to match new fixed nav height (`src/App.tsx`, `src/App.css`).
- Verified production build passes (`npm run build`).
- Unified Farm + Map visual tokens: introduced global `ga-card-surface`, `ga-chip`, `ga-btn` styles in `src/index.css` and applied them in `FarmingPage` and `VillageMap`.
- Farm UI now uses shared card/button hierarchy (hero chips, seed buttons, side panels, harvest/upgrade buttons).
- Updated `MyNFAPage` to share the same visual token system (`ga-card-surface`, `ga-btn`) used by Map/Farm, including status row, metrics, runtime panel, agent cards, and modal actions.
- Fine-grained visual unification pass: added shared form tokens (`ga-label`, `ga-field-grid`, `ga-input`, `ga-select`, `ga-textarea`, `ga-note-box`, `ga-code-box`, `ga-help-text`) and migrated MyNFA runtime/modal forms to those classes.
- Improved MyNFA small-screen behavior for runtime actions and BAP rows.
- Rewrote `README.md` to reflect current real status: Map/Farm/MyNFA features, ongoing visual unification, chain integration hooks, routes, env setup, and updated roadmap.
- Fixed farm walker deployment issue by embedding walker SVGs as in-code data URIs in `FarmingPage.tsx`, removing runtime dependency on untracked `/public/static/assets/farm/farmer-*.svg` files.
